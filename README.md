# Shut the box

Goal is to get the lowest score possible.

Play consists of the following:
1. player rolls two dice
    - if 7, 8 and 0 are covered, player may choose to roll just one die
2. add up the dice and shut numbers 
    - for example, if dice roll totals 9, player can close any one of the following:
        - 9
        - 1 and 8
        - 2 and 7
        - 3 and 6
        - 4 and 5
        - 1, 2 and 6
        - 1, 3 and 5
        - etc.
3. if nothing can be shut, sum up the numbers that have not been shut and that is the player's score
